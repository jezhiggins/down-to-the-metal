Computer science has given up a little bit at this point, so there isn't a canonical name.

Unless you think this last step is called an abstract interpreter (or possibly a solver), in which case we're into deep, deep computer science and that's a whole different talk (which I will be happy to come back and given another time).

Here's Cell's evaluator. This is 98 lines, so smaller than the parser, but a just shy of twice as long as the lexer.

This reads a stream of ASTs, here in the `evaluate` function. Each AST is passes to `eval_expression`, which returns the Cell value which is the result of that expression.
