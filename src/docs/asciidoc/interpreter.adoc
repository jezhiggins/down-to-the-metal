So we've got our program, so it's time to crack open our mystery software box.

Let's have a think about what's happening inside here.

* we've got the read the program

* we've got to make sense of the program

Those are two separate things - reading and comprehension are not the same.

Once our little piece of software has read and made sense of it, we can

* go through and actually execute the program, we can perform those actions.

So within our piece of software we've got these three separate little subsystems, and because _computer science_ we can't just call them the reading, making sense, and doing parts.

The lexer is going to read our program source.

And finally the evaluator,

or the executor, or the execution engine, or the code generator

And we call this whole thing, as you've probably guessed, an interpreter or a compiler.

So we have our three elements in our piece of software here. Let's zoom in on the first one, on our lexer.
