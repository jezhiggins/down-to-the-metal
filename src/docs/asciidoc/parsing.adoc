[large]#Parser#

[.notes]

We have our code, which we've run through our lexer - (nearly said pass through there, which might have sounded confusing) - and our lexer is giving us this sequence of tokens.

The lexer, remember, isn't giving any meaning to these the tokens, it's just saying "I've found these things, in this order".

The job of the parser is to read that stream of tokens, and start to understand & apply structure to those tokens.
