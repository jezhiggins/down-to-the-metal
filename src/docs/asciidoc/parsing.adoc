We have our code, which we've run through our lexer - (nearly said pass through there, which might have sounded confusing) - and our lexer is giving us this sequence of tokens.

The lexer, remember, isn't giving any meaning to these the tokens, it's just saying "I've found these things, in this order".

The job of the parser is to read that stream of tokens, and start to understand & apply structure to those tokens.

print("Hello!");

[source]

Let's pop back to our little print line from a few moments ago.

We can see what the line of code is, right?  We can read it and we just know it's a function call. We're call the function called print (or more properly in cell, the function assigned to the symbol print), and we're passing the string "hello".

How do we know this?

Because we're amazing!


As we read it, we're actually moving back and forth between tokenising and parsing, we're unconsciously scanning forward and back all the time. We're using information that comes later in the line to provide context for something earlier.

If any of you have children that you've helped to learn to read you'll perhaps recognise some of this process, particularly if your child had maybe dispraxia or some other reading comprehension problem and you had to start to break down your own processes.

Obviously, computer programming languages are far less sophisticated that natural languages, and deliberately so. Even in cell, which is about as simple as you can get, parsing out this line has some complexity.

print("Hello!");
--

Well that's just a symbol, could be anything.
--

== !

[source]
--
print("Hello!");
--

[source]
--
[ symbol, 'print' ]
[ (, '' ]
--

[.notes]
--
Ah, it's a function call!
--

== !

[source]
--
print("Hello!");
--

[source]
--
[ symbol, 'print' ]
[ (, '' ]
[ string, 'Hello!' ]
--

[.notes]
--
Here's the parameter - Hello!
--

== !

[source]
--
print("Hello!");
--

[source]
--
[ symbol, 'print' ]
[ (, '' ]
[ string, 'Hello!' ]
[ ), '' ]
--

[.notes]

And it's the only one.
--

== !

[source]
--
print("Hello!");
--

[source]
--
[ symbol, 'print' ]
[ (, '' ]
[ string, 'Hello!' ]
[ ), '' ]
[ ;, '' ]
--

[.notes]
--
And that's the end of this line. Cool.

So, to understand this line, to parse it out, the most significant token is the left bracket.

That bracket gives context to the token that came before, and also tells us what to expect in the tokens to come.

Clearly this tree of expressions could be arbitrarily deep.

This tree is what the parser is all about building.

Abstract Syntax Tree

is the primary output of the parser.

It's a tree, obviously, that reflects the syntax of the program. It's abstract in the sense that it necessarily directly reflect the code as written.

For example in languages with operator precedence, say, or rules about function parameter evaluation order, we would reflect those in the AST.

Let's have a look at Cell's parser.

It is, as you might expect, a little bit more involved that the lexer - it's a little over twice as long - but it's not hugely complex.

As with the lexer, this is put together as a JavaScript generator. You pass in the token stream, and it gives you back a series of AST, abstract syntax trees. (We can think of the program as either one big syntax tree, or a series of smaller ASTs with each one representing a block of code, a function definition, or whatever. Whichever is more useful at the time.)

This function _expression_ is where the work happens.

We get the token, and decompose it into its type and value. Then we say, well, what's the type.

Let's think about our print("Hello!"); example.
In the examples we've been looking at we started with a symbol, then we call back in, and our next token is the left bracket ...

We call back in and back in as we build our little trees at each stage. This is a computer science classic - the recursive descent parser. We're finding the top-most piece of our tree, then we recurse down until we've exhausted the input and filled out all the leaves. (LL parser - find leftmost).

More complex languages may not get immediately into recursion, or may recurse at different levels. Cell is fully dynamic, but you might be performing type checks, etc, as you build the AST.

Is that clear - does that all make sense?
